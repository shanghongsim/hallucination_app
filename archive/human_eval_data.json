This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA Team Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player ever to receive defensive honors). While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch performances including a 25-point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers. He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series.

The success of the show led to a number of fantasy series being commissioned on television, including a retelling of the \"Lord of the Rings\" by Amazon Studios. According to Neil Gaiman, whose works \"Good Omens\" and \"American Gods\" were adapted for TV, \"Game of Thrones\" did help change attitudes towards fantasy on television, but mainly it made big budgets for fantasy series more acceptable. The success of the genre had been attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.",

As Duke of Chartres he distinguished himself commanding troops during the Revolutionary Wars but broke with the Republic over its decision to execute King Louis XVI. He fled to Switzerland in 1793 after being connected with a plot to restore France's monarchy. His father Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9) fell under suspicion and was executed, and Louis Philippe remained in exile for 21 years until the Bourbon Restoration. He was proclaimed king in 1830 after his cousin Charles X was forced to abdicate by the July Revolution. The reign of Louis Philippe is known as the July Monarchy and was dominated by wealthy industrialists and bankers. He followed conservative policies, especially under the influence of French statesman Fran\u00e7ois Guizot during the period 1840\u201348. He also promoted friendship with Britain and sponsored colonial expansion, notably the French conquest of Algeria. His popularity faded as economic conditions in France deteriorated in 1847, and he was forced to abdicate after the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848. He lived out his life in exile in the United Kingdom. His supporters were known as Orl\u00e9anists, as opposed to Legitimists who supported the main line of the House of Bourbon.",

To make the math easy let's say Wisconsin was worth 100 delegates and had 10 congressional districts all worth 10 delegates each. If Bernie were to win every single one of those districts by a margin of 52-48 each district would have to set their delegate allotment at 5.2 delegates for Bernie, and 4.8 for Hillary. You can't award a fraction of a delegate, so what happens is that they would round, and both candidates would earn 5 delegates. Netting the overall delegate for the state 50/50 for both, despite Bernie getting 52% of the vote. It's a tiny difference, and this an extreme example showing all the rounding going in favor of one candidate.

If a large offshore spill releases oil into the open ocean, currents and winds can carry oil across all of the habitats where sea turtles are found\u2014and into the potential path of sea turtles of every age\u2014as it makes its way to shore.

Sweat itself is effectively odorless to humans, the smell from BO comes from the bacteria eating proteins in your sweat.\n\nYou have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction.\n\nYou find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. \n\nYour thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. \n\ntl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell.

This continued until 1985, when the American people finally expressed enough unhappiness over this sneaky shit that Congress discontinued funding to the revolutionaries in Nicaragua.\n\nEnd of story?  Nope!  The Reagan administration then began selling weapons internationally to raise the money to send to the revolutionaries.  This is completely against US law, but he did it anyway.  What's even worse is that he was selling the weapons to Iran, which later came back to bite the US in the ass.  We routed the money through Panama and Manuel Noreiga, who took a cut of the money and was also involved in drug trafficking to the US, so Reagan was illegally funding revolutionaries AND the skyrocketing drug industry in the US.

Probably the most famous of them is baseball legend Ted Williams (see below). But no one has actually been revived, because the technology to do so still does not exist. Critics say companies that perform cryonics are simply bilking people out of their money with the promise of an immortality they cannot deliver.

A standard case of applying optical flow visualization is convective heat transfer. Variations of the fluid density are caused by the respective temperature distribution.

If the outdoor temperature in your region dips below freezing regularly, you may want to avoid installing an air-source heat pump. The reason for this is because air-sourced heat pumps typically need auxiliary heating when temperatures drop below freezing. Air-source heat pumps pull heat out of the air, but that can be challenging when the air temperature is very cold, which causes auxiliary heating to kick on.\nDocument [3](Title: Home Energy Magazine - Indoor Air Quality :: Insulation in the heating system--A Source of Black Stains): is caused by deteriorating insulation or by candle soot.

        "question_ctx": "I wouldnt mind a little molecular detail...",
        "answer": "The reason has a little to do with light, and a little to do with how our eyes work.\nThe first thing to note is that the sky is blue. The short answer to this is because of a thing called [Rayleigh scattering](_URL_1_). The longer answer is covered in many ELI5 why is the sky blue posts.\n\nNext we need to note that the sun is white, everyone draws it yellow and I've heard a couple of explanations of this: it's hard to draw white on a white sheet of paper, the sun is yellow lower in the sky when we can see it. If you want to check for yourself, don't look at the sun. Instead get a white sheet of paper and shine a yellow light on it inside, what colour does it look (Yellow)? Then go outside what colour now (white)?\nAs others explain in the blue sky posts, the light from the sky comes from the sun and has violet, blue and some green light in it, leaving mostly red, orange and yellow left coming straight from the sun. This is why the sun looks yellow-red during sunset.\n\nThe final physical step is that clouds are white. This is from a slightly different type of scattering called [Mie scattering](_URL_0_). When the particles (in this case water drops in the coulds) are much larger than the wavelength of light, they scatter it pretty much the same, no matter the wavelength, this gives clouds, paper and milk their white colour.\nSo we have a redish-orange sun and bluish sky reflected from white clouds, because of the way our eyes work we don't see the clouds as both red and blue, the colours are mixed. If you recall art class, red and blue make purple, and depending on how much of the light is reflected from each source the colour of the clouds vary from pink to purple to orange.",

That is why no variation represents an example of evolution. No matter how much you crossbreed different breeds of dogs or horses, the results will still be dogs or horses. No new species will ever appear, as the agricultural scientist Dr. Don Batten summarizes: ... variation within a kind, such as through breeding or adaptation, is not evolution. All the biological genetic \"evidence\" for evolution is actually variation within a kind, not evolution at all. 183 Variations can never give species totally new characteristics. For that reason, no variation is\nDocument [2](Title: EVOLUTION \u2013 FACT OR SCIENCE FICTION? | Real Conversion): put dogs with black hair and send away all dogs with any other color of hair, you will get a breed of dogs with only black hair. You can do the same thing with birds, or cats, or horses. But you can never change a cat into a horse, or a dog into a bird. That can\u2019t happen.

Medical science still has very little to offer with regard to curing illness caused by viruses. This has nothing whatsoever to do with evolution. The dog-breed argument also doesn\u2019t prove evolution because they are still dogs! These dogs are not evolving into new types of creatures. The creationist can easily account for the many dog breeds that would result from speciation from the original dog \u201ckind.\u201d Here is an observation that is right,\nDocument [4](Title: EVOLUTION \u2013 FACT OR SCIENCE FICTION? | Real Conversion): \u201ckind\u201d which includes dogs and wolves.

        "answer": "From Wikipedia\n\nVaginal lubrication is a naturally produced fluid that lubricates a woman's vagina. Vaginal lubrication is always present, but production increases significantly near ovulation and during sexual arousal in anticipation of sexual intercourse. Vaginal dryness is the condition in which this lubrication is insufficient, and sometimes artificial lubricants are used to augment it. Without sufficient lubrication, sexual intercourse can be painful to women. **The vaginal lining has no glands, and therefore the vagina must rely on other methods of lubrication. Plasma seepage from vaginal walls due to vascular engorgement is considered to be the chief lubrication source, and the Bartholin's glands, located slightly below and to the left and right of the introitus (vaginal opening), also secrete mucus to augment vaginal-wall secretions.** Near ovulation, cervical mucous provides additional lubrication.",

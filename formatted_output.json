Synesthesia Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. People who report a lifelong history of such experiences are known as synesthetes. The term is from the Ancient Greek \"syn\", \"together\", and \"aisth\u0113sis\", \"sensation\". The earliest recorded case of synesthesia comes from the Oxford academic and philosopher John Locke, who, in 1690, made a report about a blind man who said he experienced the colour scarlet when he heard the sound of a trumpet.\n----\n[Doc 3]\nTitle: Synesthesia in literature\nText: Synesthesia in literature Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which one or more sensory modalities become linked.

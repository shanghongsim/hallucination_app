        "answer": "In the UK ~~school~~ education is compulsory up to age 16, when students take their GCSEs (General Certificate of Education). You get one GCSE per subject. Students have some level of choice over which subjects to take, but things like maths, English and science are compulsory. Student can end up with anything between about 4 and 14 GCSEs, but 10 or 11 is most common. They will be awarded a grade (A*-E, or U for ungraded) for each GCSE they take.\n\nAfter GCSEs a student has the choice to quit ~~school~~ education or go on to get further qualifications. The most common of these qualifications are called A levels. \n\nA levels typically take 2 years to complete and are studied at either a 'sixth form college' which basically means staying in school for years 12 and 13 (GCSEs are taken in year 11), or just a college, which is not the same as the colleges you have in the States. Here, college refers to an institution for post 16 learning, but below degree level. Whichever way you choose, the qualification is worth the same. \n\nStudents have complete choice over which subjects they wish to study, provided they have the necessary GCSEs. Most students start off taking 4 A levels and continue 3 on into the 2nd year. (They still get a qualification for the one they drop, it's called an advanced subsidiary (AS) level and is worth roughly half an A level)\n\nAt the end of the 2nd year they will be graded for each A level they took, again A*-E or a U.\n\nUniversities primarily accept or reject students based on their A level results. Uni applications however typically occur well before the A level results day. Consequently university consider applicants predicted results and then offer them a place *conditional on them getting the required grades*. Results day is therefore a very nerve racking time for students. \n\nHope this helps.",

Heathcote's findings were backed up by Japanese data published in 1996 and by an Italian study in 1999. The latter concluded that men's ears were significantly larger than women's, that ears did tend to get bigger as people got older, and that the growth occurred in both men and women. Whatever Parris thinks, this is not just an old man issue. It may be that women wear their hair longer, so we are less aware of their ears. Several reasons have been adduced for the growth.

While the pinna does play an important role, the mechanisms most critical to hearing are found deeper within. Take, for instance, hair cells. These sound receptors help transmit auditory signals to the brain, so they're tucked safely away in the inner ear. If you need more evidence that hearing ability is not connected to ear size, consider this: Our ears grow as we age, but our hearing ability usually decreases. Over a period of 50 years, the average human ear grows approximately one half-inch (1 centimeter) [source: Heathcote].

        "output": "Yes, ears do tend to get bigger as people get older [1][3]. The growth occurs in both men and women [1]. This phenomenon is not limited to just older men, as women may wear their hair longer, making their ears less noticeable [1]. The growth of ears is believed to be due to sagging with age [1]. However, it is important to note that while ears grow as we age, our hearing ability usually decreases [3].",

For this one, we have to consider what happens as x approaches 0 from the left (0-) and the right (0+).

What 'material' fills these spaces? Dark matter? The empty space between the atomic cloud of an atom and its nucleus is just that: empty space, or vacuum. That's the simple answer, but there are a few subtleties: 1) Sub-atomic particles such as electrons, protons and neutrons need to be treated as quantum objects. Thus they have a wavefunction which can be *thought of* as the 'spread' in the particle's location.

As is often the case in scientific illustration, the answer depends on what you are trying to show. Many illustrators prefer space-filling models because the large spheres lend themselves to dramatic lighting effects (see Figure 6). However, one must realize that these effects are purely artistic since an atom is incapable of producing a highlight, a core shadow, or reflections. More importantly, a space-filling model completely obscures the bonds between atoms, making it nearly impossible to tell which atom is connected to which.

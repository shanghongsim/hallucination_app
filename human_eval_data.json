        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "Not an American, but the big advantage of a national debt in very basic terms is that you have a lot of money. You can use that money to stimulate the economy.  \n  \nFor example, imagine you want to start a business selling widgets. You can go and get a small business loan, then spend that on a small widget making machine. Then you can sell those to make enough money to pay back the loan. But instead of that, you want your business to grow. You don't want it to just sit there making a half dozen widgets here or there, as some bigger widget company will overtake you and you'll be out of business. You've got to grow. So you take out a bigger loan. You buy an industrial widget maker, and hire some widget machine operators and train them, and rent factory space. Now you're making more money, and you could start paying that loan back, but the other widget companies are encroaching. You've got to keep up. You've got to get a larger factory with a bigger loan. Then you need more factories. Then overseas manufacturing centers, and HR departments, and security guards and offices with desk tidies and little signs that say \"You don't have to be mad to work here but it helps!\" and it all adds up, and you're looking at how much you owe, and you realise the only way to pay it back would be to stop expanding, but if you stop expanding and advertising and growing you'll be overtaken in the market, and no-one will think your widgets are the best anymore and if they think that, then people might start asking for the loans back sooner, or not offering you loans, or charging more interest, and you soon realise the perception of your widgets is as important as the widgets themselves and you've locked yourself into a vicious cycle where you can never stop borrowing or the whole house of cards will collapse.  \n  \nBut you're making lots of widgets. And you're employing lots of people.",

When water is still, it is like a mirror, reflecting the beard and the eyebrows. It gives the accuracy of the water-level, and the philosopher makes it his model. And if water thus derives lucidity from stillness, how much more the faculties of the mind! The mind of the Sage, being in repose, becomes the mirror of the universe, the speculum [reflector] of all creation.

        "question_ctx": "Seriously, every movie I've wanted to see are playing in select theatres. Birdman, Whiplash, Selma, Foxcatcher...the list goes on. ",
        "answer": "This happens every year.  In order to qualify for the Oscars and Golden Globes, the film has to be released before the end of the year in LA and NYC.  So, usually the middle or last week of December, films that studios and distributors know are likely to win are released in those two markets to qualify for being released in, say 2014.\n\nBut, that's also a big time for big-budget blockbusters with the Christmas Season and winter breaks.  Since these films tend to be more artsy or dramatic, they can't compete in the wide release market.  So, they're held by the studios for a January-February wide release the following year, just in time to increase their buzz when the nominations are announced and drive more business to the theaters in the first couple of weeks.  This is important for financial reasons:\n\nThe first couple of weeks of wide release is when, contractually, the distributors reclaim from the theaters the bulk of the ticket sales prices, whereas limited releases are negotiated and treated separately, and don't affect the general trendlines for a wide release.  What you don't want is next to no ticket sales the first two weeks of wide and a big spike on the third because they go from getting about 95% of ticket sales week 1, 80% week 2 to about 50% week three, 25% week 4, etc.  The longer the film is in theaters, the less money the distributor makes from the ticket sales and the more that returns to the theater owners.",

In 1993, she received a New York Film Critics Circle award for her role in \"Farewell My Concubine\" (1993). Directed by Chen Kaige, the film was her first major role with a director other than Zhang Yimou. In the same year, she was awarded with the Berlinale Camera at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. \"Premiere\" magazine ranked her performance in \"Farewell My Concubine\" as the 89th greatest performance of all time. She also worked with renowned director Stephen Chow in comedy films \"\" (1991) and \"Flirting Scholar\" (1993).\nDocument [3](Title: Gong Li): International Film Festival.

The first known globular cluster, now called M22, was discovered in 1665 by Abraham Ihle, a German amateur astronomer. However, given the small aperture of early telescopes, individual stars within a globular cluster were not resolved until Charles Messier observed M4 in 1764. The first eight globular clusters discovered are shown in the table. Subsequently, Abb\u00e9 Lacaille would list NGC 104, NGC 4833, M55, M69, and NGC 6397 in his 1751\u201352 catalogue. The \"M\" before a number refers to Charles Messier's catalogue, while \"NGC\" is from the New General Catalogue by John Dreyer.\nDocument [2](Title: Galaxy cluster): a galaxy cluster.

In the last few decades, they are also found to be relevant sites of particle acceleration, a feature that has been discovered by observing non-thermal diffuse radio emissions, such as radio halos and radio relics.

        "question_ctx": "My buddy and I are having an argument.  He wants to purchase a Moog synthesizer.  I suggested he find a computer emulator or software rack with a Moog, like Reason, and use that.  It seems you get a lot more for your money.  He thinks the product would be inherently inferior to buying the \"real thing.\"  He is comparing it to buying a Yamaha violin to a Stradivarius.  Please help us settle this argument.  Why would you buy the physical synthesizer instead of an emulator?",
        "answer": "Physical synths have no latency - even the fastest software will have latency.\n\nPhysical synths are always going to work without a hitch - you never have to worry about software glitches or overloading the system. They might be harder to work with  &  get hooked up, but they're not going to say \"UPDATING WINDOWS - REBOOTING\" in the middle of working.\n\nThere are also arguments to be made for *not* having every tool/sound in the world available at the click of a mouse.  Forcibly restricting yourself to a set of tools stops you from spending 3 days trying to decide which particular synth would work best.  Limiting yourself to a single synth  also forces you to learn it in depth.\n\nMost people are going to prefer to go with virtual stuff on a PC - the market has spoken.  Since making music is a creative endeavor, you can't completely decide the question on purely technical merits, the subjective feel of the tools is also important.\n\nIf you go to any music sub or forum, you'll see this is one of those eternal debates that never gets resolved.",

        "question_ctx": "Our area is introducing a second area code, for the reason that we are \"running out of phone numbers\". However by my calculation there are 282,475,249 possible 7 digit phone number combinations (7^10 ) which is close to the population of the United States (~318,900,000 people). How can we be running out of phone numbers in such a small area if the number of possible phone numbers is so close to the population of the ENTIRE U.S.?",
        "answer": "As others have stated, your math is incorrect, there are only 10,000,000 possible numbers. But that gets reduced even further:\n\nPhone numbers can't start with 0 or 1, so there's 2 million numbers right there that are completely invalid. 200-0000 is the first possible valid phone number. Anything beginning with 555 is invalid, so remove 10,000 more numbers from the pool of valid numbers. Now, any x11 prefix is invalid too. Those are reserved for information, 911, etc. 80,000 more numbers out of the pool. So an area code only has fewer than 8 million possible valid numbers.\n\nNow it gets more complicated. Numbers have historically been assigned to carriers in blocks of 10,000 - basically, a telecom company owns a prefix. With number portability, this line has been blurred somewhat, my phone number is an AT & T owned prefix because they were my first cellular carrier, but I'm on T-Mobile. But, nonetheless, a smaller local carrier might own a block of 10,000 numbers, say with the 321 prefix, but only be using 2,000 of them. In the meantime, Verizon is quickly running out of free numbers in the dozens of blocks they own in an area code. They can't assign numbers out of the 321 prefix because they don't own it. So an area code could be running out of numbers when major carriers can't get any more free blocks, even if there are some free numbers in it.\n\nNow, you have landlines, mobile phones, business lines (some offices may have hundreds, if not thousands of incoming numbers in an area code). Tablets and other devices on a cellular network have a phone number assigned too even though the number can't be used for anything. Between my cell phone, LTE iPad, office phone, and home security system which uses the cellular network as a backup, I'm using 4 phone numbers. Suddenly, the 7 million valid numbers in an area code doesn't go very far in a large metro area.",

Because of its mountainous nature and the numerous waves of migration from central China in the course of history, Fujian is one of the most linguistically diverse places in all Han Chinese areas of China. Local dialects can become unintelligible within . This is reflected in the expression that \"if you drive five miles in Fujian the culture changes, and if you drive ten miles, the language does\".

However, the massive migration of northern Han Chinese into Fujian region mainly occurred after the Disaster of Yongjia. The J\u00ecn court fled from the north to the south, causing large numbers of northern Han Chinese to move into Fujian region. They brought the Old Chinese spoken in the Central Plain of China from the prehistoric era to the 3rd century into Fujian. This then gradually evolved into the Quanzhou dialect.

Between 1850 and 1856 the Presiding Officer in the Legislative Council was known as the Speaker. Sir Richard Dry was the first elected to hold this position.

        "answer": "1) It is a training program that focuses on real world strength built through high intensity workouts. _URL_0_  &  _URL_1_\n\n2) It differs from a regular gym experience tremendously. At a traditional gym, your exercises center around isolation of target muscle groups by using machines to do low-rep, heavy weight sets. With Crossfit, you do not isolate muscle groups (there are no legs days or biceps days or shoulder days) and you combine Olympic lifting (snatches, power cleans, deadlifts, etc.) and bodyweight exercises (pull-ups, burpees, push-up, etc.) to work complex muscle groups and build endurance. The focus with Crossfit is on strength rather than big muscles.\n\n3) People find that there is a lot of cultishness in the community, which they find off-putting. That is partially true, but I've found that it's no more cultish than any other group of the sort. However, what Crossfit is these days is *visible*. So you get your haters. I think there's also a lot of resistance from die-hards coming from a traditional body-building background who don't like that Crossfit effectively tells them they've been doing it wrong and that makes them negative.\n\nFWIW, I've found the Crossfit community to be incredibly positive overall. Sure, there are some douches, but there are douches everywhere and they don't represent all Crossfitters.",

        "answer": "Here's a part answer for you. I'm sure there are more educated people than I that will teach us both a thing or two.\n\nIt's true that both will raise HR but running raises HR for a reason. \n\nIt's not just the increase in HR that makes running \"good for you\". Strengthening/enlarging the heart is only one of the adaptations that cardio workouts cause in the body, many others (increased mitochondria in the muscles, greater concentration of haemoglobin in blood, increased efficiency of waste product removal, etc) all occur at the same time because they are all part of the same job in the big picture...they all work together to deliver oxygen to working muscles. This means you get better at delivering oxygen and can work harder (run faster) as a result.\n\nMy training's in exercise physiology so the rest is more of a guess.\n\nDoing cocaine is a stimulant that will increase HR but to no end. There's no point in the heart working harder to pump more blood around the body per minute, the muscles aren't working like a runners muscles are so they're not asking for more oxygen. The heart will pump blood around the body faster but it's only going to the digestive system and the kidneys faster. You're not getting any of the other benefits and, as others have already said, you're getting lots of negative physical and mental side effects (like tolerance and dependence if you keep at it).\n\nHope that answers some part of it for you",

Sasha Fierce\" (2008). \"If I Were a Boy\" was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad, who also handled its production alongside Beyonc\u00e9. Inspired by the difficult break-up of a romantic relationship, the song was initially recorded by Jean, whose record company rejected it. Beyonc\u00e9 then recorded her own version. Jean was upset when she learned that Beyonc\u00e9 was releasing it as a single, but eventually, they reached an agreement.

Jean said that the fact that Beyonc\u00e9 recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics. She refused their offers, desiring to use her songs for her own album. However, Jean still intends to write for other artists. \"If I Were a Boy\" is a midtempo pop and R&B ballad, with folk rock and\nDocument [3](Title: If I Were a Boy): US. The accompanying music video for \"If I Were a Boy\" was directed by Jake Nava and shot in black-and-white. With a theme of role reversal, it is conceptually similar to the American comedy film \"Freaky Friday\" (1976). A video for the Spanish version of the ballad was edited from the original clip. Beyonc\u00e9 promoted \"If I Were a Boy\" through live performances at venues including \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", the 52nd Grammy Awards, and the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310). The song has been covered several times on televised music competitions. American singer Reba McEntire sang a country version\nDocument [4](Title: If I Were a Boy): the potential to become a big hit.

        "answer": "Background: Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the solar system located on the planet Mars. Olympus Mons is both tall (taller than Mt. Everest) and wide with almost the same area as the state of Arizona. Mars is about half the size of the Earth so it no longer has a large molten interior and the kind of active geologic processes that drive volcanism. So Olympus Mons is not likely to go off but what if?\n\nThe fact that Olympus Mons is large doesn't mean that it's eruptions would be hugely dramatic. Olympus Mons is a shield volcano much like Mauna Loa on the big island of Hawaii. When a shield volcano erupts the lava is really runny (i.e. low viscosity). Explosive volcanoes like Mt. St. Helens have much thicker lava (high viscosity) that trap gasses and thereby build up large amounts of pressure.\n\nTo summarise: If Olympus Mons did somehow erupt it would probably spill a really runny lava. That lava would cool making Olympus Mons just a little bit bigger.",

But there is also other stuff like white blood cells, platlets, antibodies.  \n\nNow the neat thing about the red blood cell is that it contains none of your DNA.  As the blood cells mature in your bones, they lose their nuclei which contains your DNA.  They do this so they can carry move oxygen making them more efficient.\n\nSo when someone receives your blood, they are getting most of these cells, the DNA-less red blood cells.  \n\nSome of those other cells will sneak along, but they are there is such small amounts that they don't show up in most standard DNA screenings.",

That's actually the basis of one of the theories on how we came to develop organelles, endosymbiotic theory. Basically, it's the idea that some/many of our organelles, like mitochondria, were originally separate single celled organisms, which were then essentially devoured or merged into what would become eukaryotes.\n\nAnyway, the third parent in this situation donates an egg, which contains mitochondria and various other organelles, but has had its nucleus removed. Then the nucleus of an egg from the other female parent is placed inside it, and sperm containing DNA from a third parent is added.\n\nAFAIK, it's always been two women, one man so far, but you should be able to perform the procedure with any three people. It would just involve additional steps to move the DNA around into sperm cells or eggs or whatever.",

Some projects are intentionally left with an unfinished appearance, particularly the follies of the late 16th to 18th century. Some buildings are in a cycle of near-perpetual construction, with work lasting for decades or even centuries.

Gaud\u00ed devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, when he was run down by a streetcar, less than a quarter of the project was complete. Relying solely on private donations, Sagrada Familia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War, only to resume intermittent progress in the 1950s. Since commencing construction in 1882, advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have enabled faster progress and construction passed the\nDocument [5](Title: Sagrada Fami\u0301lia): on the crossing and supporting structure for the main tower of Jesus Christ as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory fa\u00e7ade.

Relocated in 2002 from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, the building now houses an exhibition.

Sometimes the genetic material that is sent by the \"parent\" is slightly different than what is \"received\" by the \"child\".\n\nOn an individual level, the environment may cause one to react slightly differently to the same situation. If this difference helps the individual to survive \"better\", further generations of that individual also have the \"better\" genetic code.\n\nRepeat this process over hundreds of generations, and you have evolution.",
